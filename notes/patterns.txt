// patterns & tricks

- Major trick is to observe the problem and find out patterns .

- Array
- most common is sorting the aray using sort to perform actions
- two pointers , to evaluate two values at once 
- extra array for marking 
- inplace marking
- use of unordered set to store counts or use its properties for marking 
- -ve index - circular - (index+n)%n;
- +ve index - outofbound circular - (index % n);
- if the time complexity is high then try to break the code using loops to minimize complexity like n^4 to n^3 for example [ triplet sum - instead of using 3 loops use one loop and two
  pointers approach ]
- moore voting algotithm [The intuition behind the Moore's Voting Algorithm is based on the fact that if there is a majority element in an array, it will always remain in the lead, even after encountering other elements.] { For majority element problem }
- Binary search
- the trick is to keep the basics in the mind , bs is all about s , e and mid
- simply find out the condition with mid to get the solution
